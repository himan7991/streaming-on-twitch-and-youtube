# Streaming on Twitch and YouTube
Looking to see which site is the best for streaming in 2021? Look no further.

This is a complete guide/map of all the benefits, shortcomings, and differences between the two platforms

If you have something to add, please use the Issues tab and I will add it!

For now:
<ul> 
  <li>If you want to read everything about Twitch, check the Twitch folder</li>
  <li>If you want to read everything about YouTube, check the YouTube folder</li>
</ul>
  <p>Also for now, the <strong>YouTube folder is empty</strong> because I still haven't finished the Twitch file yet. Additionally I'm looking for YouTube streamers that can help me with some things, similar to the "documentation" I have done for Twitch. If you are interested, feel free to use the Issues tab or send me a DM on Twitter.</p> 
  
Soonâ„¢:
<ul>
  <li>After completing both files I will combine them into one and make a more comprehensive/easily readable file</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to read this mess I made </strong> until I have time to make it into a pretty word document: </p>
Since this is not a simple JSON, but a JSONC (meaning it also supports comments) there are a couple steps you have to do to.
<i>Unfortunatelly I don't have time to develop a JavaScript program to do this automatically right now.</i>
<ol> 
  <li>Visit https://komkom.github.io/ and paste the entire code in the text area</li>
  <li>Visit https://codebeautify.org/jsonviewer, paste the code you get from the first site and click Tree Viewer</li>
</ol>

Alternatively you can use the .txt file I have in the Twitch folder, which is a simplified version of the .jsonc file. (NOT UPDATED)
If you want to contribute and make it into a pretty word document that would also be appreciated. Feel free to send me a DM on Twitter
