                points through StreamLabs or StreamElements bots

            /* Alternatives
                poll.ma.pe
                    Advantages
                        Poll shows as overlay on stream
                        Can be seen by people watching the VOD
                        Looks cool
                    Disadvantages
                        Only the broadcaster can start the poll since it is linked to the twitch account
                Strawpoll
                    Advantages
                        Mods can start a poll
                    Disadvantages
                        Poll has to be pasted as link in chat
                        People watching the VOD will not be able to access the poll (I think)
